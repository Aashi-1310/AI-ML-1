# **Sudoku Solver** 🔗  

Welcome to the **Sudoku Solver Project**! 🌟  

Sudoku, a puzzle of logic and strategy, has captivated minds for generations. This project transforms the classic game into an exciting computational challenge by leveraging **Backtracking algorithms** to solve even the most complex Sudoku puzzles automatically.  

By employing efficient search strategies and optimization techniques, this project offers an intelligent solution to solving Sudoku grids in record time. With an intuitive **GUI interface** built using **Tkinter**, users can easily input puzzles and see the solution unfold step by step. Whether you're a puzzle enthusiast, a developer fascinated by algorithms, or someone looking to explore the power of backtracking in action, this project offers a fun and educational way to deepen your understanding of algorithm design and problem-solving. 
Join us in this journey to bring artificial intelligence to the world of puzzles! 🚀

## Features: 
 - Solve 6x6 Sudoku puzzles using backtracking.
 - Easy-to-use GUI for puzzle input and solution visualization.
 - Modular design with TODOs for contributors to:
 - Validate input fields to ensure valid integers between 1-6.
 - Notify users if the puzzle is unsolvable.
 - Load puzzles from a file and save solved puzzles.
 - Classify puzzles by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).
 - Add visual solving process and metrics like recursion depth.
